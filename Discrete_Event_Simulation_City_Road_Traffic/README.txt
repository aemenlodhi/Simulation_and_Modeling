Develop a simulation of a section (from 10th to 14th street) of Peachtree Street, Atlanta City, at around 4pm.  This analysis will be focused on capturing the distribution of vehicle travel times during the rush-hour period as they traverse this stretch of Peachtree St.  You will be provided with some data and statistics extracted from the physical system to use as both initial conditions for your simulator and for validating your results.
